// in javascript every code has a global execution context refer to this
// in browser it refers to window Object

// execution context types


// 1. Global execution context  
// 2. Function execution context
// 3. Eval execution context

/*
üîπ 1. Script Starts (Power On)
JavaScript engine begins executing your code.

üîπ 2. Global Execution Context (GEC) is Created
This is the default environment.

this refers to the global object (window in browsers).

GEC goes through two phases:

üîπ 3. Memory Creation Phase (MCP)
All variables declared with var ‚Üí undefined

Functions ‚Üí Full function definition stored

this ‚Üí set to global object

üîπ 4. Execution Phase (EP)
Code runs line-by-line

Values are assigned to variables

Functions may be called

üîπ 5. When a Function is Called
A new Function Execution Context (FEC) is created

It goes through its own:

Memory Creation Phase

Execution Phase

üîπ 6. After Function Executes
Result is returned to where it was called (usually GEC)

Function Execution Context is removed (popped from call stack)
           or wencan 
üîÅ Once function finishes:
It returns a value (if any)

That value is sent back to where it was called from (typically the GEC)

The function's execution context is destroyed (popped off the call stack)
